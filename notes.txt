css is added just under the title
script.js ia added just above the closing of the body 

meta data is very useful for search optimisations and SEOs
target = _blank is used to get the new tab on clicking something 

SEO and web core vitals
CLS:- Cumulative Layout Shift (kitni jaldi pages shift on something )
LCP:- Largest Contentful Paint (hitting target audience ko sabsa bada page kitni der ma load hoga 2.5)
FID:- First Input Delay(agar user na kuch input kia to kitni der ma output aiga 100ms )

 ab Meta itna use nahi hota as it was abused by the people page ha pet ka bara ma likh aur aur dia taki SEO pass kar de 
for in the label is to be filled by the id of the input tag 

inline jitni required utni space and block matlab sari space it can be changed using display property in css

id is unique like adhar number 
class means 1 insaan ki multiple classes ho sakti haan and 1 class ma  ultiple elements bhi laga sakta haan 
# is used with class in css and . is used with id 
controls for video is mute loop autoplay poster(like thumbnails of the video)

preload means you want ki website phele hi data fecth karle 
to add a svg file xmlns add karna padta ha verna file nahi dikhti svg wali
iframe is used to embed one website into your website 

semantics tags are used by seo to detect what is written and where is it written 

if you want to write something which is similar to the syntax of html then we use entities and pre tags 

to put code in the website always use the code tag and also use the pre tag if you want to put as it is and also obsolete tags are those that are now not in ise in html and css and are not even recommended to use 

Box Model
Every tag in html works on bos model that is it has content then padding then border then margin 

border sizing border box use karoge to total height mentioned padding ko milakar verna only content ki hoti ha vo 
if margin is overlapping to bus bada wali count ho jaigi ek baar 

if text is imported using import then add below style opening tag if using link then just above the style opening tag 
text style
line spaceing
letter spacing
text decoration  

types to involve colors in the code are:-
colore name
hexcodes
rgb
rgba
hsl


in css if there is any conflict that which colour is to be selected then we use specificity algorithm 
if same selector then the last one in the line is considered otherwise specifcity is used 
inline css>ID selector>Cass or Attribute Selector>Element Selector>Universal Selector 

agar !important user kardia to usko hona hi padega ye inline styles ko bhi override kar dega 

for specificity calculation give 
universal selector-0
element or pseudo is 1
class attribut 10
id selector 100
inline styles 1000

if . is used between 2 like h1.cred so both the specificity will add 

different units for spacing and all
vw:- on use of it the object takes the size according to view portsize of the screen 
margin auto is used tio automatically align from the left and the right only for block elements 
similarly vh is used for height 
em is jitna inherited size ha uska utna guna jitna mentioned ha like 2 em means do guna 
2 rem matlab jitna root element ka size ha uska 2 guna 
vmin and vmax are min and max of the vh vw if same then it remains unaffected 

block elements can be converted into inline elements using display:inline and inline-block if you want to set padding width etc 
display:none sespace aur content dono gayab
visibility:none se only content gayab spacew to wahi rahegi 
flex can also be used to do the alignment and can be justified using justify 
grid is also display property 

box and text both can be given the shadows 
using the shodow and aga ka syntax
outline is not the part of box model but the border is the part of box model and offset of the outline can be increased , border can be curved and outline follows the same it cant be changed individually into curved corners 

In list the markers are outside the style in order to include them inside the background colour or the border user list style position inline 

if there is insuffcient width height then we use css overflow 
white space nowrap is used to showcase text only horizontally and not vertical content and overflow auto is used to get the scroll bar in case the content overflows 
text overflow ellipsis is used to get the ... if the content overflows 
overflow clip is used to stop the scrolling of the overflowed text even 
overflow x and y can be treated individually as well 

static position matlab jahan ha wahi rahegi 
aga piche lana ka lia z index is used uska lia position ko phele relative karna padega 
absolute position ma nearest positioned ancestor ka relative lagta ha agar position nahi ha transform, filter jaisa kuch ha to bhi neareest parent ka according set hoga 
position fixed ma vo fix rehta ha chahe scrolling kyu na hori ho 
in case of sticky vo wahi chipki rehti ha chahe scrool kyu na ho raha ho jab uspa reach karenge tab hilegi 

variales in css are used in order to change things only on one click of thing like color to be changed to red from yellow
syntax for declaration of global variables are:-
:root{
    --color:
    --secColor: 
}
usage: 
: var(--color);

if overided with local variable then vo use hoga 

media querries are used to make the website responsive 
syntax:-
@media not|only mediatype and (expression like max-width:455px){
    css style
}

float alows the things to move to that side and allow the rest items to occupy rest of the empty space 
example float left
display flow root is used to prevent the overflow 
clear is used ki na left ma dikh na right ya dono mA HI NA dikh 
dont use float and clear ever 

flex box is basically used for alingnment 
justify content centre se horizontally alignemnt ata ha aur align items se vertically alingnment ata ha 
flex firection ma item lay hoti haan and generally its left to irgh but it can be changed as well
main axis matlab jiska sidh ma item lay hori ha and uska perpendicular hoti ha cross axis 
flex wrap is used to prevent the overflow and agli line ya column ma content push kar deta ha automatically 
content word is used when there is more than 1 line or column 
there is no justify item in flex box 
wrap reverse se ulta wrap ho jaiga 
flex flow is used to set flex direction and flex wrap 
gap is used to give the spacing between each of the item of the ciontainer 
row and column gap can be set separately 
ye yaad rakhna padega ki konsi property container ki ha aur konsi property item ki ha and usi ka style ma usko dalo 

order is the property of an item and jitna zyada order utni der se vo item aiga 
flex grow is is used ki vo item kitna item ki jagah lega akela 
flex shrink is used to shrink whenever needed when the size of container is less than needed 
flex shrink 2 matlab doguni speed se ghategi speed
align of a particular item can be done using align self 

grid is used to reprepresent grid in inspect
and its no of columns and rows can be changed and hum ab kahi bhi chiza place kar sakta hu 
grid row start: grid row end is same as grid row 1/2
to name the line or columns while declaring the tempelated we can use[name] to set the name 
we can also give the area name 
fr unit is also used fr means fraction of totalexample 1fr 1fr 1fr so it means 1/3 1/3 1/3 of available space 
align items and justify items se positions of items can be changed 
repeat(4, 1fr) matlab 1fr,1fr,1fr,1fr
place content se justify and align sath ma ho jata ha 

2d and 3d transforms :-
transform keyword is usedit can be done about any axis, angles turns and skew can also be done that particular axis ka about pakadkar kheech dia, but skew z axis ka about nahi hota 
translate matlab apna height length ka respect ma translate karna 
(tutorial 42 k code refer karo)

transition property:-  eg transform
transition duration:-  eg 3s
transition timing function:-eg ease in out
transition delay:- eg 1s
if we put all in transition property in that case its applied to all the properties 
in order to combine all 4 properties transform: then all 4 values separated by space,

Animation:-
@keyframes keyword is used to include animations followed by name and then from to 
all properties can also be combined here 
filmmode:-
